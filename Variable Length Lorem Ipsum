Variable Length Lorem Ipsum 

Specify a range of lengths for your lorem ipsum text

Most Figma lorem ipsum plugins let you specify a single number for word count. However, sometimes you want to specify a range instead, to introduce variability, and create more realistic results (realistic for lorem ipsum text, that is)

Features:
Generates lorem ipsum text with the option of varied lengths.
Enter a single number (e.g., "10") for fixed word count or a range (e.g., "5-10") for random variation within limits.
Optionally add punctuation for generated text (default: off).
Optionally auto-close the plugin after generating text (default: off).
Supports your system setting for light or dark mode.

Roadmap:
Save user preferences for future sessions.
Allow custom text input for generation.
